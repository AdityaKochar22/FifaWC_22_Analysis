## Project Overview:
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of the FIFA World Cup 2022, offering insights into team performance, match statistics, and key metrics. The visualizations help users understand team efficiency, defensive strength, and overall tournament trends.

## 📊 Dashboard Components & Visuals
<b>1️⃣ Summary Cards (Top KPIs)</b><br>
Displays the overall tournament statistics:<br>
✅ Total Goals – Number of goals scored in the tournament.<br>
✅ Total Assists – Number of assists provided.<br>
✅ Total Wins – Total matches won by all teams.<br>
✅ Total Losses – Total matches lost.<br>
✅ Total Red Cards – Number of red cards given.<br>
✅ Total Yellow Cards – Number of yellow cards given.

<b>2️⃣ Possession % by Team (Bar Chart)</b><br>
A horizontal bar chart to visualize how well each team controlled possession during their matches.
Helps identify possession-dominant teams versus counter-attacking teams.

<b>3️⃣ Ball Recovery (Matrix Table)</b><br>
Displays ball recoveries per team in a matrix format.
Useful for assessing defensive pressing and work rate.

<b>4️⃣ Aerial Duels Won vs. Lost (Bar Chart)</b><br>
A side-by-side bar chart showing aerial battles won and lost per team.
Identifies teams strong in aerial duels (e.g., teams relying on long balls & set pieces).

<b>5️⃣ Win Probability Gauge Chart (DAX-based Calculation)</b><br>
A gauge chart using a Win_Prob DAX Measure to estimate a team’s probability of winning based on:<br>
Goals Scored<br>
Possession %<br>
Shots on Target<br>
Expected Goals (xG)<br>

<b>6️⃣ Tackles vs. Interceptions (Column Chart)</b><br>
A clustered column chart comparing tackles won and interceptions per team.
Helps assess teams with strong defensive pressing.

<b>7️⃣ Goals vs. Expected Goals (Bar Chart)</b><br>
A bar chart comparing actual goals vs. expected goals (xG) per team.
Helps analyze teams that are overperforming or underperforming in finishing.



## 🎯 <b>Key Insights from the Dashboard</b><br>
📌 Teams with high possession do not always translate it into wins.<br>
📌 Some teams overachieved in goals scored compared to their xG (clinical finishing).<br>
📌 Defensive teams with high ball recoveries and interceptions were effective in counter-attacks.<br>
📌 Aerial dominance played a key role for certain teams in set-piece strategies.<br>
📌 The Win Probability Gauge Chart provides a data-driven match outcome predictor.<br>

## 🛠 Power BI Features Used<br>
✔ DAX Measures – Custom calculations for Win Probability.<br>
✔ Conditional Formatting – Color-coded visuals for easy interpretation.<br>
✔ Custom Visuals – Used gauge charts & matrix for enhanced analysis.<br>
✔ Filters & Slicers – Interactive elements for dynamic exploration.<br>
